Just an absolute thriller.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame the broadcasting was subpar as usual today since there was about 8-10 laps prior to showing the lead fight where Leclerc was within 6-9 tenths behind at certain points in EACH of those 8-10 laps that they didn't show whatsoever (even a small pop-up screen in the bottom right corner as they sometimes do would suffice- just anything) but at least they showed the final 15-20 laps of them fighting it out.. It was just super frustrating watching live and wanting to know what was going on at the sharp end rather than seeing Verstappen trying to hold back Norris or seeing the 2 Williams (who are doing supremely well and do deserve air time) but if there's 0.5s gap between the lead- that HAS to be the focal point...

If you watch the replay from above Perez drives straight and even steers a tiny bit to the left. He is far enough alongside that Sainz can't dictate Perez's racing line. So he had every right to stay in the middle of the road.\nSainz on the other hand creeps over to the left and doesn't drive straight on. You can see that again in the replay. \nBut you also have to acknowledge that the track goes slightly left on that straight. Even with that in mind I feel like Sainz turned too much into Perez and had been granted enough room on the outside. \n\nAgain these are very small margins and because of that I don't really think any driver is at fault."

He had one and a half car width of space to avoid contact and he had the DRS anyway, he would've passed Sainz even by going left. \r\n\r\nThis is just some absolutely shocking awareness from P\u00e9rez's side and that's purely dangerous for any driver racing next to him. Sainz was just defending his place by compromising P\u00e9rez's line, that's not illegal whatsoever. 100% on P\u00e9rez on that one.\r\n\r\nAnd what's even more shocking is that, instead of going left and keep a podium to salvage his absolutely godawful season (istg even Kvyat did better back in the days), he preferred to play it reckless (I don't even think he was looking at Sainz at that point) and score a big bold 0 while his team's already struggling big time for points. I really wanna know what was the logic behind what he did. Just freaking avoid the contact, no? Then maybe you can complain and get Sainz penalized"

Being so heavy and balanced compared to older cars. Now formula 1 is a lot more mental in my opinion, you have to be thinking about how you can outsmart your opponent instead of out driving them, atleast in my opinion a lot of drivers drive very similarly in terms of speed. If everyone had the same car I\u2019d bet the result would be quite shocking to find the difference is almost none.

If P\u00e9rez had his nose ahead it would have been on Carlos a 100% but he didn't so Sainz had the right to control the lines on that straight as long as he didn't put Sergio in a wall. wich he didn't cause they collided before."
