It's the accordion effect. When an incident happens, the cars behind are likely to rear end each other as there is unexpected braking. However, it's not the immediate cars behind. Usually the closest cars can see the original incident and prepare to slow. The car that usually rear ends first, is the first car that is unable to see the original incident. In this case, the car is reacting to the braking of the car in front alone and not the incident which is a much shorter window. You can see on Stroll's onboard he can't see Alonso at all.\n\nYou see this happen in a lot of turn 1 lap 1 incidents. Where a car just seems to not brake a few cars behind but not immediately behind the original incident.\n And people go, he didn't even try to brake! not realizing the reasons why that type of accident happens.",

Even though MV locked up, and as a result ran deep, he has track position in that corner and it should be LH responsibility to adjust his line - yielding the corner if necessary to avoid the collision. If MV ran so deep\/wide that he forced LH off track on the outside I'd blame MV, and maybe we'll never know, but IMO LH should have yielded as he was on the outside and behind.",

With slower vehicles, it's the slipstream, with series that have a greater disparity of driver skill (F2 and 90s F1), it's due to mistakes. \n\nGenerally speaking, it takes a significant performance disparity to be able to cruise up on another person and have the pace to negate the inherent advantage the defending car has... and this is present in all motorsports due to it just being how the physical world works. Same way tires are a factor in any form of motorsports, because having slightly worse tires means you're slower into the corners, through the corners, and even on straights due to how you need traction to actually put that power into the ground.",

After viewing the poster exhibition and documentary, people in the audience said they had a deeper understanding of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) willingness to commit atrocities and wanted more information about Falun Gong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poster Exhibition \"Stop the CCP's Organ Harvesting of Living People\" was held at the Asaka City Industrial Culture Center from September 29 to October 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreening of \"Human Harvest,\" a documentary about the state-sanctioned harvesting of human organs from living practitioners in China\r\n\r\n\r\nSpectators shocked by CCP atrocities\r\nIn addition to the posters, in a separate room, visitors were able to watch videos detailing the crimes of harvesting human organs from live practitioners in China. People's expressions became solemn after seeing the costumes and some were moved to tears, shocked by the costume that such cruelty could occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne woman in her 50s said: \"I've never heard of it. It's so cruel. I was so shocked I couldn't speak.\" Through tears, she asked what she could do to help.\r\n\r\n\r\nA commenter told him that people could talk to their legislative representatives to get them to pass a law to end crime and that some local councils had passed resolutions that they sent to Congress. The woman said she would share the information with her friends and bring them back when the event resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne teenager said this was the first time she heard about harvesting organs from living people. \"It's very sad that so many people had their organs harvested while they were still alive.\" She wanted to do something to help, so she said she would tell her friends. She also took photos to share online.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man went to see the poster exhibition with his high school daughter. \"I saw the pamphlet that said, 'Silence means being on the side of the persecutors' and I felt I had to come and know the truth.\" He also said he would bring his friends when the event returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nA 50-year-old man said, \"Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to know the facts. I didn't know that the CCP was responsible for such evil. I don't think Taiwan should become part of China. I will tell other people I know what I saw it today.\"",
